      <h1>Save The Lions of Africa</h1>
      <p>They need you - especially now. Don’t let poachers exploit the COVID-19 crisis.Lions have long been considered the kings of the jungle,
        <br>but perhaps their reign is coming to an end.The population of African lions is less than what it was just three decades aga,<br>
        and their population has been wiped out across much of Africa.Unless we act now , African lions could be extinct by 2050.<br>

        <span style="font-style:bold; font-size:30px;">Protecting Africa's most threatened species.</span><br>
            Save the lions of Africa was established in 2020.It is created to support Initiative 1401, <br>
            a first-of-its-kind ballot measure in Washington State which prohibited the purchase,<br>
             sale, and distribution of products made from a list of 10 endangered animals.<br>
             Working closely with partners from the nation’s leading conservation, education, <br>
             and zoological organizations, as well as grassroots donors from across the United States,<br>
              I-1401 passed with over 70 percent support in November 2015.<br>
